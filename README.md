# E-Style

E-Style is a professional-grade Python project designed to streamline and enhance data processing, experimentation, and pipeline management within the domain of data science and machine learning. With an emphasis on modularity and clarity, E-Style leverages both Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks to deliver a robust and reproducible research workflow.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Pipeline:** Organized directories for data storage (`data/`), pipeline components (`pipeline/`), and utility functions (`utils/`).
- **Interactive Analysis:** Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experimental tracking.
- **Modular Codebase:** Clearly separated logic for scalability and ease of maintenance.
- **Reproducible Environments:** All dependencies managed via `requirements.txt`.

## Directory Structure

```
E-Style/
│
├── data/                   # Raw and processed data storage
├── notebooks/              # Jupyter notebooks for EDA and experimentation
│   ├── EDA.ipynb
│   └── train_experiments.ipynb
├── pipeline/               # Data pipeline and modeling scripts
├── utils/                  # Utility modules and helper functions
├── main.py                 # Main execution script
└── requirements.txt        # Project dependencies
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ajsike2310/E-Style.git
    cd E-Style
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

- **Running the main pipeline:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
- **Exploratory Data Analysis & Experimentation:**
    Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory using JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.

    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    # or
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Notebooks

- [`EDA.ipynb`](notebooks/EDA.ipynb): Exploratory Data Analysis
- [`train_experiments.ipynb`](notebooks/train_experiments.ipynb): Model Training Experiments
